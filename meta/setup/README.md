### Setup

No matter how you wish to contribute, you'll need
[a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't have one already.
If you're not familiar with [`git`](https://git-scm.com) and
[`GitHub`](https://github.com), you might find the
[MDN Git and GitHub document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/GitHub)
helpful.

There are several ways forward from this point. It's up to you.
Here are some options:

1. Go to <https://github.com/mdn/content> and just use the
[GitHub UI](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github).
This is the easiest approach if you just want to make a simple change to
a single file, like fixing a typo.
1. Install and use the [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-desktop)
1. Install and use the [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-cli)
1. [Install `git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and use it from the
command line. You might find these resources helpful:
    - [Using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git)
    - [`git` cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/)

If you choose an option other than the GitHub UI, you want to install
[Node.js (version >=12.11)](https://nodejs.org) and [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
